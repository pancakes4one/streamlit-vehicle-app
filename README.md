Vehicle Listings Explorer
This is a simple interactive web app built with Streamlit and Plotly Express that allows users to explore and visualize vehicle listings data. The tool helps users simulate and understand trends in used car prices, mileage, listing duration, and more.

Project Overview
This project is part of a data visualization sprint to simulate random events. The dataset is visually explorable to answer key business questions like:

How does mileage affect car price?
Do expensive cars stay listed longer?

Tech Stack
Python 3.13
pandas – for data manipulation
plotly.express – for interactive visualizations
streamlit – for building the web app
